## 🧑‍💻 About Me

With over 10 years of experience in software development, I specialize in building high-performance web applications and back-end services. I have a strong background in PHP, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Laravel, Vue.js, and React.

From working in fast-paced startups to contributing at large-scale platforms like Etsy, I've designed APIs, optimized CI/CD pipelines, mentored developers, and led feature delivery from concept to production. I'm passionate about writing clean, testable code and continuously improving systems for real-world business needs.
